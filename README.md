# css

Just a collection of CSS files I use often.

I'll start with the one for my documentation. Despite the name beeing `markdown.css`, it actually supports `org` files.  
The color scheme is heavily inspired from Solarized.

The other file `pro.css` is different and to be used for large displays/documents.
